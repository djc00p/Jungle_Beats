# Jungle_Beats


## Objective

In this project we're going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, I made a very basic drum machine program.

This is a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Requires Ruby 2.4.1

### Installing Application

```
$ git clone git@github.com:djc00p/Rales_Engine.git
$ cd Jungle_Beats
$ bundle install
```

### Using the application

In the terminal type `pry`

```
$ require "./lib/jungle_beat"
$ jb = JungleBeat.new
$ jb.append("deep doo ditt woo hoo shu deep doo ditt woo hoo shu")
$ jb.play
```
 There you go!!! Making sound from you computer with a linked list!
